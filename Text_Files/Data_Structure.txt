1. Heap
	- Heap is complete binary tree with 2 variation i.e maxHeap and minHeap
	- The constraint is the root should be always greater/smaller than both the child.
	- Heap was imagined as tree but the staore is in array/list.
	- Diffrent Nodes from current nodes can be onbatined by
			- Parent of Current -> (Current_pos-1)/2;
			- Left child 		-> current_pos *2;
			- Right Childe  	-> curremt_post*2 +1;
			
	- The heart of Heap is heapify function.
	- Insertion in heap -> to insert any elemnt in heap we insert it at last to main complete binary constainrnt, and them we check its parents is maintating the heap property(min/max)
							or not and then we bubble up till root.
	- Deletion in Heap 
		- just remove the node and replace it with last node and do heapify on that node.(this will work if you want to delete any node).
	- Pritorty use min/max heap .
	
2. Dynamic Programming ( not a ds but a algo solving pradigm)
	- genrally used to solve optimization / combinatrocal que 
		ex -> min max , no of ways etc.
	- steps to solve a dp que ( not genralized)
		- 1. find the objective funvtion :- what u want to do
				ex:- f(i) :- is the no of ways you can reach state i; (it can be mutli variable also)
		- 2. find base cases ( cases for which u already know thw ans)
		- 3. find the recuurnce relation :- ( the most tricky and 90% of the que )
		- 4. find the order of execution ( i.e bottom up or top/down)
		- 5. where will be your final answer stored. ( if using a aaray to solve the ans ot temp variable)
		
3. Graph -> how to prepare sequentially
	- its a type of non-linear DS.
	- A graph is represented by Sets of Nodes(vertices) and edges.
	- A edge can be uni/bi directional.
	- All the trees are grapghs but not reverse.
		
	- learn how to build/implement a graph.
	- Learn how to traverse it ( BFS,DFS)
	- Learn to find whether graph is cyclic / acylic ( can be called as tree)
	- Learn to compute shortest path ( bfs,djistras)
	- Topological sorting.
	- Minimum spanning tree ( Prims and kruskals)
